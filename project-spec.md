# Product Name: "Drive Drawers"

Imagine "Drive Drawers" as your personalized, virtual filing cabinet for all your cloud storage services, living right in your browser. Instead of jumping between Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox tabs, or their desktop apps, you'd have a unified interface.

## Core Features

Here are some key functionalities that would make "Drive Drawers" indispensable:

- **Unified Dashboard:** A single, clean interface accessible via a browser icon. From here, you'd see all your connected cloud services (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.) as "drawers."
- **Drag-and-Drop Organization:**
  - **Browser to Drawer:** Easily drag files, images, or even entire web pages (saved as PDFs or MHTML) directly from your browser into specific folders within any of your connected cloud drives.
  - **Drawer to Drawer:** Seamlessly move or copy files between different cloud services (e.g., from Dropbox to Google Drive) without downloading and re-uploading.
- **Quick Save & Tagging:** When you're on a webpage, a right-click option "Send to Drive Drawers" could pop up. This would let you:
  - Choose which cloud service and folder to save to.
  - Add custom tags (e.g., #receipts, #projectX, #inspiration) right at the point of saving, making future searching much easier.
- **Intelligent Search:** A powerful search bar within the extension that queries across all your connected cloud drives simultaneously, including searching by filename, content (if the cloud service supports it), and your custom tags.
- **Contextual Actions:** Right-click on a file within Drive Drawers to perform common actions:
  - Share file (generate shareable link).
  - Preview file.
  - Rename, delete, copy, move.
  - Open in native cloud app/web interface.
- **Version History at a Glance:** For supported file types and cloud services, quickly see or access previous versions of a document.
- **Customizable "Drawers":** Allow users to rename their cloud services within the extension (e.g., "Work Drive," "Personal Files," "Shared Projects") to better reflect their organization.
- **Offline Access (Cached):** Select important files or folders to be cached locally (encrypted) so you can browse their contents even without an internet connection, with automatic syncing when back online.

## The "Drawers" Metaphor in Action

The "Drawers" concept isn't just a name; it could influence the UI/UX:

- Visually, each connected cloud service could literally appear as a "drawer" you click to open, revealing its contents.
- Perhaps a "Recent Drawers" section that shows the last few places you saved or accessed files, just like physical drawers you frequently open.

## Why "Drive Drawers" Would Be Awesome

The biggest win here is consolidation and efficiency. Users often juggle multiple cloud services for different purposes (work, personal, shared projects). "Drive Drawers" would eliminate the friction of managing these separate silos, making file saving, finding, and organizing a unified and intuitive experience. It taps into the desire for better organization and seamless workflow within the browser environment.
